Sudoku is a game of arranging numbers from 1 to 15 in the form of a snake on a small square of 4x4 cells. This program works exactly the same way. In the first window there are buttons “Start game” and “Exit”. In the second window there are buttons "Check", "Start over" and "Exit". The game helps improve brain function.
